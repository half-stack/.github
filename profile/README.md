# Half-Stack Organisation

Half-Stack is a collaborative space for developers who enjoy working on projects with minimal restrictions. Our goal is to bring together a community of tech enthusiasts to contribute to a single, overarching project. Here, you have the freedom to choose your own technology stack, allowing for creativity and innovation without the constraints of rigid guidelines.

The only requirements are to use a microservice-based architecture and to ensure your code includes working tests. This ensures that each contribution fits within the broader vision we call the Big Goal. This Big Goal is collectively defined by our members, ensuring that everyone has a say in the direction of our project.

At Half-Stack, we believe in having fun and not taking things too seriously. Join us if you're looking for a place to experiment, learn, and build something awesome with like-minded developers.
